# Push Swap - Sorting Algorithm

## Description
**Push Swap** is a sorting algorithm project that involves sorting two stacks, stack A and stack B, using a specific set of operations. The goal is to sort stack A in ascending order with the smallest number at the top, using a minimal number of operations.

### Mandatory Part

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `make` to compile the `push_swap` executable.
3. Execute `./push_swap` with a list of integers as an argument to sort the stack.
4. The program will display the minimum number of instructions required to sort the stack.

### The "push_swap" Program
- The program takes a list of integers as an argument, with the first argument at the top of the stack.
- It displays the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack.
- Instructions are separated by a newline character (`'\n'`).
- The goal is to sort the stack with the lowest possible number of operations.
